--Welcome to Exposing Exploitation--
We are a group of individuals committed to exposing the widespread exploitation of children that exists beneath the surface of nearly every social media website. 

In highlighting the dark realities of how vulnerable young people are manipulated, abused, and exploited over the internet, we seek to bring these realities to the attention of the public so that steps can be taken to protect children. We also seek to hold social media websites accountable for the countless predators who capitalize on the vulnerability of our society’s most helpless individuals. Finally, we seek to identify the individuals and groups who are responsible for committing these abuses so that proper justice can be rendered for their actions.
